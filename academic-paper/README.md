### **Important Note**

**The papers in this directory are fictional academic artifacts generated via Human-AI collaboration (involving the author and multiple AIs). All components—authors, affiliations, dates, data, results, references, and journal names—are fabricated for illustrative purposes. No real-world empirical claims are made.**

This meta-exercise explores "Human-AI Collaborative Intelligence" by demonstrating framework creation through dialogue. It evolves from theoretical foundations (E-CEI) to extensions (X-CII), simulation-based robustness, and axiomatic formalization with synthetic evaluation. For real-world analogs and updates, refer to the GitHub repository.

**Updated as of September 20, 2025**: Revised to incorporate the fourth paper's formalization of X-CII, emphasizing axiomatic properties, Box-Cox aggregation, and Monte Carlo synthetic evaluation (e.g., median Relative X-CII of 108.7% [95% CI: 107.2-110.1%] vs. baselines).

This directory hosts a series of fictional papers on Human-AI Collaborative Intelligence, spanning theory construction, hypothetical validation, simulation robustness, and synthetic formalization. The framework evolves iteratively, addressing gaps like dynamic metrics, uncertainty handling, and ethical integration. Community feedback has refined the focus on reproducibility and axiomatic rigor.

## Framework Evolution Overview

The papers trace the framework's progression:
- **Stage 1 (Theoretical)**: Introduces E-CEI for synergistic evaluation.
- **Stage 2 (Extension & Hypothetical)**: Evolves to X-CII with dynamic components and simulated 12-month validation.
- **Stage 3 (Simulation Validation)**: Applies Monte Carlo (10,000 replicates) for robustness under uncertainty, reporting median Relative X-CII of 112% (5-95th percentile: 104-120%).
- **Stage 4 (Formalization & Synthetic)**: Defines X-CII axiomatically (Box-Cox average of Q, E, S; λ=0.25) with synthetic Monte Carlo evaluation, showing robustness (e.g., median Relative X-CII 108.7%; Core ≥0.75 in all runs).

This structure bridges conceptual gaps, emphasizing complementarity, safety thresholds, and domain adaptation.

Integrates simulations from Paper 3. |
