### **Important Note**

**The papers contained in this directory are fictional academic papers generated through a collaborative process between a human (Torisan Unya [@torisan_unya]) and multiple AIs.**

All elements within the papers—including author names, affiliations, dates, experimental data (e.g., number of participants, duration, numerical results), references, and journal names—are entirely fabricated to serve the concept of this project. They are not based on actual research or real-world facts.

The purpose of this project is a **meta-exercise**: to demonstrate and explore the theme of "Human-AI Collaborative Intelligence" through the very process of generating the papers themselves. Consider it an experiment to see how sophisticated and compelling academic artifacts can be created through dialogue with AI.

This directory contains a series of research papers on Human-AI Collaborative Intelligence. These papers cover the full scope from the construction of a theoretical framework to its empirical validation and practical application.

## Papers

### 1. Theoretical Framework

*   **Filename:** `01_theoretical-framework.md`
*   **Title:** *Human-AI Creative Collaboration: A Theoretical Framework for Synergistic Innovation*
*   **Summary:**
    This first paper proposes the "Enhanced Collaborative Effectiveness Index (E-CEI)" as a foundational theoretical framework for evaluating human-AI creative collaboration. It serves as the theoretical basis for the subsequent research.

### 2. Extended Framework & Empirical Validation

*   **Filename:** `02_extended-framework-validation.md`
*   **Title:** *Extended Framework for Human-AI Collaborative Intelligence: Empirical Validation and Practical Implementation*
*   **Summary:**
    This paper extends the theory from the first paper by introducing a more dynamic "Extended Collaborative Intelligence Index (X-CII)". It validates the effectiveness of this index through a large-scale, 12-month empirical study and presents a practical protocol for organizations to implement the framework.
