### **Important Note**

**The papers contained in this directory are fictional academic papers generated through a collaborative process between a human (Torisan Unya [@torisan_unya]) and multiple AIs.**

All elements within the papers—including author names, affiliations, dates, experimental data (e.g., number of participants, duration, numerical results), references, and journal names—are entirely fabricated to serve the concept of this project. They are not based on actual research or real-world facts.

The purpose of this project is a **meta-exercise**: to demonstrate and explore the theme of "Human-AI Collaborative Intelligence" through the very process of generating the papers themselves. Consider it an experiment to see how sophisticated and compelling academic artifacts can be created through dialogue with AI. For the latest updates on related frameworks, see the GitHub repository linked below.

**Updated as of September 20, 2025**: This README has been revised to include the newly added third and fourth papers, reflecting the framework's evolution from theoretical foundations to synthetic evaluation and simulation-based validation.

This directory contains a series of research papers on Human-AI Collaborative Intelligence. These papers cover the full scope from the construction of a theoretical framework to its empirical validation, simulation-based robustness testing, and formalization with synthetic evaluation. Updated as of September 20, 2025 to reflect framework evolutions and community feedback.

## Papers

### 1. Theoretical Framework

*   **Filename:** [01_theoretical-framework.md](01_theoretical-framework.md)
*   **Title:** *Human-AI Creative Collaboration: A Theoretical Framework for Synergistic Innovation*
*   **Summary:**
    This first paper proposes the "Enhanced Collaborative Effectiveness Index (E-CEI)" as a foundational theoretical framework for evaluating human-AI creative collaboration. It serves as the theoretical basis for the subsequent research. 

### 2. Extended Framework & Hypothetical Validation

*   **Filename:** [02_extended-framework-validation.md](02_extended-framework-validation.md)
*   **Title:** *Simulated Extension of Human-AI Collaborative Intelligence Framework: Hypothetical Validation and Implementation Scenarios*
*   **Summary:**
    This paper extends the theory from the first paper by introducing a more dynamic "Extended Collaborative Intelligence Index (X-CII)". It validates the effectiveness of this index through a large-scale, 12-month simulated empirical study and presents a practical protocol for organizations to implement the framework. (Incorporates ethical updates and multi-domain adaptations based on ongoing AI evolution.)

### 3. Simulation-Based Validation

*   **Filename:** [03_xc-ii_validation_simulation.md](03_xc-ii_validation_simulation.md)
*   **Title:** *Monte Carlo Simulation for Validating the Extended Collaborative Intelligence Framework: Robustness Under Uncertainty and Domain-Specific Projections [Simulation/Fictional]*
*   **Summary:**
    This paper applies Monte Carlo simulations (10,000 replicates) to validate the X-CII framework's robustness under uncertainty, including domain shifts and risk scenarios. It reports hypothetical metrics like median Relative X-CII of 112% and Core X-CII ≥0.75 in 92% of runs, bridging theoretical extensions to potential real-world pilots.

### 4. Formalization and Synthetic Evaluation

*   **Filename:** [04_x-cii_formalization_and_synthetic_evaluation.md](04_x-cii_formalization_and_synthetic_evaluation.md)
*   **Title:** *A Formalization of the Extended Collaborative Intelligence Index (X-CII): Definition and Synthetic Evaluation*
*   **Summary:**
    This paper formalizes X-CII as a Box-Cox average of normalized Q, E, and S components, with axiomatic properties and threshold optimization. It conducts a synthetic Monte Carlo evaluation (10,000 replicates), demonstrating robustness (e.g., median relative scores of 108.7% vs. baselines) and provides reproducible equations and pseudo-code for future validation.

## Recommended Reading Order

These papers represent a continuous line of research. To best understand the overall scope of the project, we recommend reading them in the following order, aligned with the framework's evolution (from theory to formalization and evaluation):

1.  [01_theoretical-framework.md](01_theoretical-framework.md) (To understand the theoretical foundation, including E-CEI metrics)
2.  [02_extended-framework-validation.md](02_extended-framework-validation.md) (For the extension of the theory to X-CII, its hypothetical validation, and practical implementation protocols)
3.  [03_xc-ii_validation_simulation.md](03_xc-ii_validation_simulation.md) (For simulation-based robustness testing under uncertainty, including Monte Carlo methods and domain projections)
4.  [04_x-cii_formalization_and_synthetic_evaluation.md](04_x-cii_formalization_and_synthetic_evaluation.md) (For the axiomatic formalization of X-CII and synthetic evaluation, with code snippets and statistical results)
