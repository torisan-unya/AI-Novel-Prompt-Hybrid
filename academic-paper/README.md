### **Important Note**

**The papers contained in this directory are fictional academic papers generated through a collaborative process between a human (Torisan Unya [@torisan_unya]) and multiple AIs.**

All elements within the papers—including author names, affiliations, dates, experimental data (e.g., number of participants, duration, numerical results), references, and journal names—are entirely fabricated to serve the concept of this project. They are not based on actual research or real-world facts.

The purpose of this project is a **meta-exercise**: to demonstrate and explore the theme of "Human-AI Collaborative Intelligence" through the very process of generating the papers themselves. Consider it an experiment to see how sophisticated and compelling academic artifacts can be created through dialogue with AI. For the latest updates on related frameworks, see the GitHub repository linked below.

This directory contains a series of research papers on Human-AI Collaborative Intelligence. These papers cover the full scope from the construction of a theoretical framework to its empirical validation and practical application. Updated as of September 17, 2025 to reflect framework evolutions and community feedback.

## Papers

### 1. Theoretical Framework

*   **Filename:** [01_theoretical-framework.md](01_theoretical-framework.md)
*   **Title:** *Human-AI Creative Collaboration: A Theoretical Framework for Synergistic Innovation*
*   **Summary:**
    This first paper proposes the "Enhanced Collaborative Effectiveness Index (E-CEI)" as a foundational theoretical framework for evaluating human-AI creative collaboration. It serves as the theoretical basis for the subsequent research. (Updated with references to real-time AI collaboration examples from X discussions.)

### 2. Extended Framework & Empirical Validation

*   **Filename:** [02_extended-framework-validation.md](02_extended-framework-validation.md)
*   **Title:** *Simulated Extension of Human-AI Collaborative Intelligence Framework: Hypothetical Validation and Implementation Scenarios*
*   **Summary:**
    This paper extends the theory from the first paper by introducing a more dynamic "Extended Collaborative Intelligence Index (X-CII)". It validates the effectiveness of this index through a large-scale, 12-month simulated empirical study and presents a practical protocol for organizations to implement the framework. (Incorporates ethical updates and multi-domain adaptations based on ongoing AI evolution.)

## Recommended Reading Order

These papers represent a continuous line of research. To best understand the overall scope of the project, we recommend reading them in the following order:

1.  [01_theoretical-framework.md](01_theoretical-framework.md) (To understand the theoretical foundation, including E-CEI metrics)
2.  [02_extended-framework-validation.md](02_extended-framework-validation.md) (For the extension of the theory to X-CII, its hypothetical validation, and practical implementation protocols)
