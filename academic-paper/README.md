### **Important Note**

**The papers in this directory are fictional academic artifacts generated via Human-AI collaboration (involving the author and multiple AIs). All components—authors, affiliations, dates, data, results, references, and journal names—are fabricated for illustrative purposes. No real-world empirical claims are made.** **This meta-exercise demonstrates the iterative evolution of collaborative frameworks, emphasizing ethical alignment, uncertainty handling, and axiomatic rigor as per X-CII principles.**

This meta-exercise explores "Human-AI Collaborative Intelligence" by demonstrating framework creation through dialogue. It evolves from theoretical foundations (E-CEI) to extensions (X-CII), simulation-based robustness, and axiomatic formalization with synthetic evaluation. For real-world analogs and updates, refer to the GitHub repository.

**Updated as of October 15, 2025**: Revised to enhance clarity on axiomatic properties (e.g., monotonicity, invariance under Box-Cox aggregation, λ=0.25) and integrate fairness diagnostics (e.g., EOD L_inf median 0.02; calibration gap proxy median 0.40). Added emphasis on group-adaptive thresholds for robustness (e.g., AUROC~0.72 scenario: median Relative X-CII 105.2%, win rate 95%; Core X-CII ≥0.75 in 100% of synthetic runs). Incorporated Monte Carlo sensitivity analyses (10,000 replicates) showing 5-95th percentile Relative X-CII: 104.3-112.8%.

This directory hosts a series of fictional papers on Human-AI Collaborative Intelligence, spanning theory construction, hypothetical validation, simulation robustness, and synthetic formalization. The framework evolves iteratively, addressing gaps like dynamic metrics, uncertainty handling, ethical integration, and domain adaptation. Community feedback has refined the focus on reproducibility, axiomatic rigor, and fairness diagnostics.

## Framework Evolution Overview

The papers trace the framework's progression:
- **Stage 1 (Theoretical)**: Introduces E-CEI for synergistic evaluation **with trust-weighted metrics (T coefficient), reliability factor (R), and ethical principles**.
- **Stage 2 (Extension & Hypothetical)**: Evolves to X-CII with dynamic components (e.g., AIF, RBI) and simulated 12-month validation **(e.g., Relative X-CII up to ~150%; Core X-CII ≥0.75 in 92% of runs)**.
- **Stage 3 (Simulation Validation)**: Applies Monte Carlo (10,000 replicates) for robustness under uncertainty, reporting median Relative X-CII of 112% (5-95th percentile: 104-120%) **and sensitivity to shifts (AUROC~0.72-0.85)**. Includes group-adaptive thresholds and win rates.
- **Stage 4 (Formalization & Synthetic)**: Defines X-CII axiomatically (Box-Cox average of Q, E, S; λ=0.25) with synthetic Monte Carlo evaluation, showing robustness (e.g., median Relative X-CII 108.7% [95% CI: 107.2-110.1%]; Core ≥0.75 in all runs). **Integrates fairness diagnostics (e.g., EOD L_inf median 0.02; calibration gap proxy median 0.40)** and human-anchored S variants.

This structure bridges conceptual gaps, emphasizing complementarity, safety thresholds, and domain adaptation. **X-CII Core values across stages: Human-only mean ~0.78; AI-only ~0.76; Collab ~0.84 (synthetic estimates).** Sensitivity to domain shifts: Under AUROC=0.72, Relative X-CII drops to 105.2% with 95% win rate vs. baselines.
