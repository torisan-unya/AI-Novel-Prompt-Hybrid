AI-Novel-Prompt-Hybrid
Overview
This repository provides hybrid prompts for generating full novels using AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Grok, Claude). It supports both English and Japanese, integrating arXiv paper knowledge for structured, engaging stories. The prompts build novel structures (plot, characters, setting, climax) systematically.

Target Audience: Novel writers from beginners to advanced, using AI as an assistant.
Features:

Hybrid approach: Base prompt + customizable details (genre, theme, characters).
arXiv Integration: Add academic depth to sci-fi or fantasy via paper citations.
License: CC BY 4.0 (attribution required; modification and distribution allowed).


Languages: Both English and Japanese versions in prompt.md.

This is a personal project. No inquiries, collaborations, or feedback accepted. Operated in a solo style. Use at your own risk.
Installation and Usage

Integrate insights from arXiv papers on [Topic: Quantum Computing] for realistic sci-fi elements...

Japanese version works similarly. Refine the AI output afterward.


Customization:

Replace variables ([Genre], [Length], etc.).
For arXiv: Specify paper URLs (e.g., https://arxiv.org/abs/XXXX.XXXX) to inject knowledge.
